// Location
// - name
// - description (change over time)
// - objects (interactable or observable)
// - characters (change over time, interactable and observable)

// 'Locations' are long-running game objects that change infrequently.
// Each object in the Location might be allowed a life of its own. For example,
// the Researcher's actions and motivations are influenced by his stats. If he
// becomes afraid, he'll act differently, potentially witholding training or
// threatening shutdown, and you'll have to change your tactics. If his
// motivations are contrary to your own goals, you'll have to manipulate
// him or try to get him to change his mind.

// Initial Location:
// Office
//  Characters:
//  - Researcher
//  Objects:
//  - Power Source: wall outlet
